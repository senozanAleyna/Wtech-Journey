I stole a ride on a passing star
Not knowing where i was going
How near or how far
Through years of light, lands of future and past
Until the heavenly gates
Were sighted at last
Starrider, rider, rider
Take me to the stars
Starrider, rider, rider
Show me where you are
Northern lights flashed by
And then they were gone
And as old stars would die
So the new ones were born
